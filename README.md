*   Download the latest release from: [Releases](https://github.com/bendavies99/BabbleBot-Server/releases)
*   Extract the archive anywhere on your machine
*   Replace the `lib` folder and replace `Babblebot` and `Babblebot.bat`

```text
NOTE: if you don't care about keeping the same folder you can copy over the folders `config` and `plugins` and your database file if you have one
```

### Automatic Updates

Babblebot has a system in place to automatically update itself when a new release is made to turn this off under the config there is `system.autoUpdate` change this to `false`

The system will only update when there is a minor or patch update which would be only Y and Z in this example `X.Y.Z`

```text
NOTE: you can update to a major version by using --updateMajor when running babblebot it is not recommended as plugins may not support this version use with caution
```

Steps to install a plugin:

*   Create a new folder for your plugin it needs to be the same name as the `.jar` file
*   Place your jar file inside that folder
*   Open up your `config/config.json` file and add inside
    ```json
      // Old
      "plugins": []
      // New
      "plugins": [{ "pluginLocation": "<!-- use folder name you used earlier -->" }]
    ```
    For additional plugins add a `,` between objects e.g.
    ```json
      // Old
      "plugins": [{ "pluginLocation": "plg1" }]
      // New
      "plugins": [{ "pluginLocation": "plg1" }, { "pluginLocation": "plg2" }]
